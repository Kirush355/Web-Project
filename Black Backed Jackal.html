                The black-backed jackal is a member of the dog family, recognized by its rusty-red coat, a black patch on its back, and a black-tipped tail. It measures approximately 95 cm (37 inches) in length. As an opportunistic omnivore, the jackal feeds on a diverse diet, including reptiles, insects, birds, fruits, berries, and carrion left by larger predators. They often hunt small antelopes in family packs.<br><br>

Two distinct populations of black-backed jackals exist in Africa: one in East Africa (Kenya, Ethiopia, and Tanzania) and another in southern Africa (Namibia, Angola, and South Africa). These adaptable animals thrive in various habitats, from deserts to grasslands and savannahs. The IUCN classifies them as least concern, meaning they face minimal threats. However, they are sometimes hunted by farmers who view them as a danger to livestock.
