                The bat-eared fox is a small member of the dog family, known for its large ears, which help regulate body temperature and enhance its hearing. Unlike most foxes, it has six more teeth and primarily feeds on insects like termites. These foxes are either solitary or live in small groups.<br><br>

Bat-eared foxes inhabit savannahs, arid scrublands, and grassy plains. Their range includes Kenya, Tanzania, South Africa, Angola, and Zimbabwe. The IUCN classifies them as least concern, with a stable population. However, threats such as hunting, disease, and drought pose challenges to their survival.
