                The white-bellied go-away bird is named after its distinct call, which sounds like "go-way". It has grey plumage, a white belly, and a large crest on its head. When in flight, white tail markings become visible.<br><br>

This bird inhabits the arid savannahs and woodlands of Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Sudan, South Sudan, Somalia, and Ethiopia. The IUCN classifies it as least concern, meaning it faces no major threats to its survival.
