                The dik-dik is a small dwarf antelope found in the arid regions of East Africa. These tiny antelopes survive in dry environments by extracting water from the vegetation they eat. To avoid predators such as eagles and cats, they take cover in dense undergrowth.<br><br>

There are four species of dik-diks, but only two are found in Kenya:<br>

Kirk’s dik-dik – The largest species, though still very small compared to other antelopes. It grows to about 45 cm (18 inches) tall and weighs only 7.2 kg (15.8 lbs).
Guenther’s dik-dik – A smaller species with a longer snout.<br><br>
The IUCN classifies both Kirk’s and Guenther’s dik-dik as least concern, meaning their populations are stable. However, they face threats from expanding agriculture and excessive hunting.
