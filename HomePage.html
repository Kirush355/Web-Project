                <strong>Information about the sanctuary;</strong><br>
                The **Animal Ark Wildlife Sanctuary** was established in 1995 by **David Mwangi** and **Lilian Atieno** in **Laikipia, Kenya**. Initially founded as a refuge for injured and orphaned wildlife, the sanctuary has grown into a well-respected conservation facility dedicated to the protection, rehabilitation, and preservation of wild animals. Covering over 50 acres, Animal Ark Wildlife Sanctuary provides a safe, natural habitat for a variety of species, including cheetahs, elephants, birds, and foxes. The sanctuary focuses on ethical animal care, conservation education, and raising awareness about protecting Kenya’s rich biodiversity.<br><br>
                
                <strong>Conservation efforts;</strong><br>
                Animal Ark Wildlife Sanctuary is committed to conservation through rescue, rehabilitation, and educational initiatives. The sanctuary collaborates with Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) and other conservation organizations to offer a permanent home for animals that cannot survive in the wild due to injuries or habitat loss. One of its major initiatives includes the **Cheetah Protection Program**, which aims to safeguard cheetah populations in Kenya. The sanctuary also promotes habitat restoration, sustainable eco-practices, and research to support conservation strategies. Over the years, the sanctuary has successfully rehabilitated and released multiple species, helping to maintain the balance of Kenya’s wildlife ecosystem.<br><br>
                
                <strong>Ways to get involved;</strong><br>
                There are several ways to support Animal Ark Wildlife Sanctuary and its mission. Visitors can contribute by donating, symbolically adopting an animal, or joining the volunteer program, which allows them to assist with animal care, habitat maintenance, and conservation education. The sanctuary also hosts community outreach programs, wildlife awareness campaigns, and guided safaris where visitors can learn from experts about Kenya’s endangered species.
